Title: Analysis of Variation in ChIP-seq using Functional PCA
Author: Pedro Madrigal <pm12@sanger.ac.uk>, with contributions from Pawel Krajewski <pkra@igr.poznan.pl>
Description: The double aim of the package is to apply a functional version of principal component analysis (FPCA) to: (1) Process data in wiggle track format (WIG) commonly produced by ChIP-seq peak finders by applying FPCA over a set of selected candidate enriched regions. This is done in order to shorten the genomic locations accounting for a given proportion of variation among the enrichment-score profiles. The function 'narrowpeaks' allows the user to discriminate between binding regions in close proximity to each other and to narrow down the length of the putative transcription factor binding sites while preserving the information present in the variability of the dataset and capturing major sources of variation. (2) Analyze differential variation when multiple ChIP-seq samples need to compared. The function 'bigwigdiff' quantifies differences between the tag-enrichment, and uses Hotelling's T2 tests on the FPC scores to identify significant differences between conditions.
